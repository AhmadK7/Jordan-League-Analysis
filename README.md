## ðŸš€ How to Run the Analysis
1. Open the `jordan_league.Rmd` file in **RStudio**.
2. Ensure the required R packages are installed (e.g., `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`).
3. Knit the file to generate the PDF report.

```r
# Example: install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
